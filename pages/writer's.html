   <p>You can’t leave out the Writer’s Building from the list of top historical places in Kolkata. Built in 1777, this building served as an office of the writers of the East India Company; hence the name. Currently, it serves as the secretariat building of the West Bengal State Government. <br><br>

    It is the same place where three revolutionaries of the Indian Freedom Movement – Benoy Basu, Badal Gupta, and Dinesh Gupta – shot and killed Colonel N.G. Simpson, the infamous Inspector General of Prisons, in 1930. Apart from its historical significance, this heritage site is also noted for its distinct Greco-Roman style of architecture. <br><br>
