    <p>Kolkata’s Town Hall is an exquisite historical edifice built in Roman-Doric architectural style. Constructed in 1813, this place was used for social gatherings of the European community living in the city at the time. After independence, the edifice fell into a state of neglect. But in 1998, its building was restored to its former glory due to the intervention of the Calcutta High Court and the Archaeological Survey of India. <br><br>

        Currently, the Town Hall is used for public functions and gatherings and counts among the top historical buildings in Kolkata. <br><br>
