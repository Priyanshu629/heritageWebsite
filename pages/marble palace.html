   <p>This palatial mansion in North Kolkata was built by Raja Rajendra Mullick, an affluent Bengali merchant. This well-preserved 19th-century residence derives its name from its marble walls, floors, and sculptures. One of the best-known heritage monuments in Kolkata, this mansion is designed in neoclassical architectural style. <br><br>

    This three-storied structure stands tall with lawns, gardens, a lake, a rock garden, and a zoo in its surroundings.
