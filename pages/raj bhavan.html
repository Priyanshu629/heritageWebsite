   <p>Raj Bhavan, one of the outstanding monuments in Kolkata, serves as the official residence of the Governor of West Bengal. Built in neoclassical architecture with Baroque overtones, this grand three-storied structure was once the seat of British Imperial power. <br><br>

    The edifice was designed by Capt. Charles Wyatt and modeled after the residential mansion of the Curzon family. Interestingly, after a century of its construction in the year 1803, this building was occupied by George Nathaniel Curzon, the most well-known member of the Curzon family, as the Viceroy of India. <br><br>
