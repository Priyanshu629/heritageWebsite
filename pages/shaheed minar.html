   <p>Topping the list of must-visit historical sites in Kolkata is Shaheed Minar. This memorial was erected in 1828 in the memory of Sir David Ochterlony, who was a commander in the British East India Company, to commemorate his victories on the battlefield. It was thus originally known as Ochterlony Monument. <br><br>

    However, in August 1969, this monument was re-dedicated to the memory of the martyrs of India’s struggle for independence and was renamed Shaheed Minar (martyrs’ monument). <br><br>
